# Curro-One

The purpose of this program is to display graphs, a map, and summary information for activities generated by a GPS watch
that stores files in the Fit Format.

Most Garmin watches and several other brands support the FIT format. 
Curro-One is a from-the-ground-up rewrite of the original SiliconSneaker in the Rust programming language.

Note:
Support for TCX files has not been provided in this version.  The original SiliconSneaker
(https://github.com/cprevallet/siliconsneaker)  may be used for viewing files of this type.
